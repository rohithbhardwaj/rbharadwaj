Rohith Bharadwaj

I am currently a freshman at Northwest Missouri State University working on my Masters of Applied Computer Science. I should be graduating next fall for my Masters, I am interested to carry forward my career path in the field of IOT (Internet of things) & Machine Learning.

I’m from Warangal, Telangana. It’s in India. I have completed my bachelor’s in Metallurgical & Materials Engineering stream in National Institute of Technology - Warangal. During my Internship at Defense Research and Development Organization I have sorted out all my opinions which are research & working at industrial sector like steel plants, which didn't interest me much due to the  risk of life and also poor security measurements & guidelines. So I had an option of moving into IT over the other options and started working in IT.

I worked for Infosys Technology Limited for around 4 and half years in various domains and technologies. I worked mainly for the Walmart Inc. client (Responsible sourcing & Supply chain Sustainability around the globe) for about 4 years as a Data analyst, Technology Analyst.  I always wanted to be an Ethical Hacker, but I felt I need to learn more in depth on current technologies. So I have decided to take a break from my current job and pursue masters in Applied Computer Sciences. I hope by the end of this course I can gain good knowledge and plan my career in Ethical Hacking, IOT & Machine Learning Technology.

My interests include going for long drives, Tennis, Badminton.
