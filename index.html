                    I am currently a freshman at Northwest Missouri State University working on my Masters of Applied Computer
            Science. I should be graduating next fall for my Masters, I am interested to carry forward my career path
            in the field of IOT (Internet of things) & Machine Learning.

                    I’m from Warangal, Telangana. It’s in India. I have completed my bachelor’s in Metallurgical & Materials
            Engineering stream in National Institute of Technology - Warangal. During my Internship at Defense Research
            and Development Organization I have sorted out all my opinions which are research & working at industrial
            sector like steel plants, which didn't interest me much due to the risk of life and also poor security
            measurements & guidelines. So I had an option of moving into IT over the other options and started working
            in IT.

                    I worked for Infosys Technology Limited for around 4 and half years in various domains and technologies. I
            worked mainly for the Walmart Inc. client (Responsible sourcing & Supply chain Sustainability around the
            globe) for about 4 years as a Data analyst, Technology Analyst. I always wanted to be an Ethical Hacker,
            but I felt I need to learn more in depth on current technologies. So I have decided to take a break from my
            current job and pursue masters in Applied Computer Sciences. I hope by the end of this course I can gain
            good knowledge and plan my career in Ethical Hacking, IOT & Machine Learning Technology.
